# Team_Tableau_Final_Project
Following is a description of our group project based on the questions presented in the class materials module_20. 

## Decide on a topic for the project—think of a question that can be answered using data.
For our group project, we are analyzing a data set from the company for which one of our team members works. The company provides energy optimization and related services for buildings of various types and services. Most of the company's work is project-based. The company bids on work and delivers services according to the scope of the client's requirements.  

The company has a key goal of bidding for projects with a proposal that would win but is also something the company can deliver without going over budget. The company has detailed data related to project type, services performed, duration, billable hours, and status. The question that we plan to answer with the data is whether we can estimate whether a given project is likely to be over of under budget based on the bid and historical patterns. 

## Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
Our assigned team for this project is: Natalie Abeysena, Loc Nguyen, and Ashok Ramaswami. We have created a project repository 'Team_Tableau_Final_Project with a master branch and three sub branches. We have invited each team member to join as contributors to the repository.

NOTE: Since the assignment, our team member Natalie Abeysena has indicated she will likely not participate due to personal exigencies. We understand the situation and will continue to work the project between the two of us that remain on the. team.

## Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
We have the dataset from the company with feature columns that we need for our analysis. Personal and other confidential information has been encoded for privacy reasons. The encoding does not impact the suitability of the dataset to build a machine learning model and develop our analysis.

## Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they’re ready for analysis.
We have started to process the raw data and are performing exploratory data analysis to prepare them for our analysis.  

## Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
We developed an initial model based on a subset of the dataset. We are each submitting the preliminary notebook that contains our initial model and the data we used.
