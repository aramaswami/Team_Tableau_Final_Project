# Team_Tableau_Final_Project
# PRESENTATION WEEK 1 - Team Tableau:

Team Tableau decided to pursue my company dataset for our project. The data topic is to perform analysis on the project efficiency. Each project has many features that potentially impacts the probability of project being overbudget, such as project duration, staff members, project budget, project type, project size, etc. We are hoping to create a model that helps answer if our current projects are expected to be underbudget, with a target accuracy of 75%.<br>

Our datasource is coming from my company, stok LLC â€“ www.stok.com. All data has been encoded to maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality: removing employee names, demographic information, project names, client names; and encoding project location and personal notes. All other data is real.<br>

This topic is highly related to my practical work, and potentially applicable to other team members. All data is real and structured, so we can avoid the risk of having bad data and reduce the work for cleanup. Besides, the project not only help answer if our current project is over-budget, it can also help us test our pricing before bidding for a project opportunities.
