# Team_Tableau_Final_Project - Week#1

## Presentation
As described in the readme in one of our branches, for our group project, we are analyzing a data set from the company for which one of our team members works. The company provides energy optimization and related services for buildings of various types and services. Most of the company's work is project-based. The company bids on work and delivers services according to the scope of the client's requirements.  

The company has a key goal of bidding for projects with a proposal that would win but is also something the company can deliver without going over budget. The company has detailed data related to project type, services performed, duration, billable hours, and status. The question that we plan to answer with the data is whether we can estimate whether a given project is likely to be over of under budget based on the bid and historical patterns.  

## Team communications
Our assigned team for this project is: Natalie Abeysena, Loc Nguyen, and Ashok Ramaswami. Since the original assignment, our team member Natalie Abeysena has indicated she will likely not participate due to personal exigencies. We understand the situation and will continue to work the project between the two of us that remain on the team.  

We have scheduled a standing weekly call, interim call/s scheduled ad hoc, and discussion during regular class time. We communicate and share files on slack, primarily; we also use email to communicate if needed.  

## Project considerations
Since we are operating with one team member short, we will adapt our work division in a manner that is effective, equitable and promotes learning. We are therefore working collaboratively on certain tasks and independently (but with coordination) on other tasks.

## GitHub - Individual branches
We have three branches, other than master, with one for each team member. Each team member has made individual commits to their respective repositories. Please review the submissions, including the readme files, in each for additional details on the project. Specifically, we cover: (i) Project overview (as per module_20 outline) and additional perspective; (ii) preliminary machine learning model (which we developed collaboratively; (iii) preliminary database discussion; and, (iv) related resources and files.

## Machine learning model
Please see our individual repositories for a description of the preliminary machine learning model. As noted above, we submitted the code as well.

## Database
Please see our individual repositories for a description of the preliminary database model. As noted above, we submitted the SQL code and ERD as well.
